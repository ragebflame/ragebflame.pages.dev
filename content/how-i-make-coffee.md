Coffee. Sweet black nectar of the gods. Here's how I make it.

## Equipment

- [An Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/)
- [Able Brewing DISK Filter](https://ablebrewing.com/products/disk-coffee-filter)
- ~~[Hario Slim grinder](https://global.hario.com/product/coffee/grinder/MSS.html)~~ [1Zpresso Q2 coffee grinder](https://1zpresso.coffee/product/q2/)
- Digital scales
- Spray bottle for water (Not critical)
- Some good locally roasted coffee ([Some I like](/wishlist/#coffee-))

## Workflow

Aeropress is set up as standard. Over cup, on a scales with the filter added (text facing up on the Able disk filter).

1. Set Hario Slim grinder @ 8 clicks. For grind size, [see below](#grind-sizes-for-hario-slim)
2. Measure 13g coffee. Spray beans with water before grind to avoid static
3. Grind beans and add to Aeropress
4. Add boiling water to ~215g weight
5. Seal the Aeropress with plunger (total weight is now ~300g)
6. Let sit for 2 minutes
7. Swirl. Let sit for a further 30 seconds
8. Plunge with natural pressure. (~30 seconds)
9. Top-up cup with water if needed. (Total coffee weight usually ends up around 300g)
10. Enjoy ☕

## Grind sizes for Hario Slim

The [Hario Slim](https://www.hario.co.uk/products/hario-mini-mill-slim-hand-coffee-grinder) is a great, affordable hand grinder that I’ve been using almost daily without issue. For an idea on how the grinder settings map to what you are brewing, I use this table:

| Type               | Number of Clicks                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Standard Drip Brew | 10 clicks                             |
| #2 Pour over       | 10 clicks                             |
| Aeropress          | 6-8 clicks (10 for inverted possibly) |
| Espresso           | 5 clicks                              |
| French Press       | 12-14 clicks                          |
| Moka pot           | 9 clicks                              |
| Chemex             | 9 clicks                              |

This is taken from a good guide [here](https://howchoo.com/coffee/how-to-adjust-your-hario-mini-mill-coffee-grinder).

> The way to measure your grind is by "clicks" away from all the way tight. You'll feel the nut click as you unscrew, so count the number of clicks. The number of clicks to unscrew should vary based on the brew method you're using.

[James Hoffmann](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ) has a great walkthrough of the different methods on his YouTube channel. I would recommend checking it out. What I do here is essentially follow his guide. With this, I can make consistently good coffee that is on par or better than the local coffee shops, all while being much cheaper 👍.
